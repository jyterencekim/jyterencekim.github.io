title: 'Why I like cheap catchy songs' 
---

I like cheap catchy songs in a four-on-the-floor rhythm. I wonder why people hate or pretend to hate them. Well, I do understand how some people can be completely indifferent about them, but I don’t see why one should *hate* them.

I remember a friend of mine once telling that he hated them because they are an insult to the intelligence of listeners. Why *insulting*, not just *bad*, though? I feel that the reason so many people get offended by them is precisely the reason I love them: they make a bold statement, *“I am sure you will get to like this.”*

This bold statement becomes insulting only when you want to deny its power in vain. To me, this boldness is strangely reassuring. Yeah, you see, there seems something so deeply ingrained in all of our minds that those songs appeal to. I am not alone in obsessing over them. There seems some universal (or quasi-universal) recipe for human joy (or, more precisely, obsession and addiction). The joy can be mass-produced and replicated without any serious thoughts about the “meaning” of art. And it is just amazing how composers manage to incorporate the magical recipe into their songs and come up with endless variations of the same power.
