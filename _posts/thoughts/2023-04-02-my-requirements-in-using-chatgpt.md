- I must be able to pinpoint what I want to know about.
	- I must be able to form my questions with proper qualifiers; I must delimit the space of *questions* that my questions share the same form with. (What kind of question do I want to ask?)
		- I am not sure whether question-pinpointing also delimits the space of possible *answers* to expect. Is the form or structure of meaningful and useful answers *implied* in their questions? Stupid questions can get great answers, which can be surprising because the way they are put in is unforeseen in the questions.
- I still have to understand what I need to look **at** to find out what I want to know about.
