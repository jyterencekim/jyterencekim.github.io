If whatever I may say may hurt others, then silence should be the best policy that I can take. But silence, unless out of respect that is sometimes duly required, gets me only so far as the status quo, if not cynicism at best.
Not every expression that hurts someone is "politically **incorrect**" but the pursuit of "political correctness" has surely a lot to do with trying **not** to hurt people. It has something to do with **justice**â€”for it does not make sense for someone or something to be correct but unjust at the same time.
Keeping the status quo in a stifling, cynical silence can never be just. So political correctness in how we talk must **not** pretend that it cannot be **offensive**. "Offensive" has now become such a triggering and tiring signal, and some complain about how everyone's got so "soft" to be offended by everything. And it is a truthful observation that there is no way you cannot **not** offend anyone, unless or **even when** you keep quiet.
Words do hurt because they have power, whatever the source of which may be. (Words by themselves may not be "weapons" though, like with each syllable barbed.) And this fact should never be a reason to shut conversations down. It should rather serve as a constant reminder for careful, informed exercise of power. From all different kinds of power follow all different kinds of offense. So my question, in trying to be politically correct as I still would like to, will be not whether my words will offend someone, but rather how is the power of my words directed. "Don't for heaven's sake be afraid of talking nonsense! But you have to pay attention to your nonsense." (Wittgenstein.)
