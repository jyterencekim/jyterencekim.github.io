Don't we expect contracts to be reliable and transparent?
Contracts that are smart enough, though, can __deceive__, knowingly or not.
I want my contracts to be immutable and simple. I want them to refer to things transparently.

Modular contracts can be useful, but don't forget that their use may not always be in our hands.
In contracts that embrace all in one, referential transparency is __given up__, not chosen instead of.

(Any action upon contracts veiled in multiple layers with side effects cannot expect a certain **pure** outcome.)
