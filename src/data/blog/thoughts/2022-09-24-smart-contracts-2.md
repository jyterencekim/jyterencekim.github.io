- Dumb and simple is safer than smart and complex.
  - "Safer" in that it is less likely to do something weird or random that you don't expect.
  - Or at least: dumb and simple actors are more likely to be **forgiven** in unforeseen misfortunes. (Things can go wrong in an unfortunate configuration of simple things.)
- If versatile contracts on blockchains must be audited thoroughly because they can do so many things and bear responsibility thus much, then how can the **cost** of ensuring security be assessed **within** the blockchain? The cost is there but is hidden because it is externalized.
