This site is the running log of projects and pocket essays by JY Terence Kim. I
use it to keep track of what I am reading, building, and trying to understand.

## What you will find

- **thoughts** — longer reflections and notes to self.
- **scraps** — partial translations, quotes, and references I want to revisit.
- **misc & dev** — writing that falls outside regular essays, including older
  archives and programming experiments.

Most pieces stay in draft form for a while. I update posts in place with edits
and extra references, so the site works more like an open notebook than a
polished publication.

## Contact

The easiest way to reach me is through
[GitHub @jyterencekim](https://github.com/jyterencekim). I keep personal contact
details intentionally light on the public web.
